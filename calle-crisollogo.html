            <div class="desc">
                <p class="txt-desc mb-3">Calle Crisologo owes its name to the illustrious Ilocano poet, writer, and playwright Governor Marcelino “Mena” Crisologo. Previously, the street was called Calle de Escolta de Vigan, whose residents were mostly families who profited from the galleon trade that included Ilocos as a key port. When Governor Crisologo died in 1927, the street was renamed Calle Crisologo in his honor.<br><br>
                    The street is part of Vigan’s picturesque Heritage Village, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This consists of about 200 beautifully restored houses dating back to the 16th century. The buildings on Crisologo particularly display a blend of indigenous Filipino and colonial European construction.<br><br>
                    Local advocates campaigned that Vigan’s architectures more similarly reflect those of old Asian trading cities like Hoi An, Malacca, or Macau. In fact, many houses in Calle Crisologo were owned not only by scions of Spanish settlers but also wealthy Chinese who migrated to Ilocos Sur to set up businesses. Calling to the city’s rich history as a trading post ultimately proved effective.<br><br>

                <h3 class="display-6">How to Get to Calle Crisologo from Manila</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Traveling by bus from Manila to Vigan will be the cheapest option, although expect to spend around 8 to 10 hours on the road. There are many bus lines offering the direct Vigan route, with premium ones such as Partas Bus in Cubao and Farinas Transit in Pasay that feature WiFi, TV, and toilets; and regular bus companies such as Dominion Bus, Aniceto Bus, and Viron Transit at relatively lower fares.</li>
                    <li>Some buses like Philippine Rabbit Bus Line, Florida, Maria de Leon, Baliwag, and RCJ Transit pass by Vigan as well, on their way to Laoag City. It is recommended to take the overnight trips so you can just sleep through the long ride and don’t save on accommodation expenses for one night.</li>
                    <li>If you want to save on time, take a flight from Manila to Laoag, which takes only an hour, and ride a 2-hour bus trip going to Vigan. </li>
                    <li>Once you are in Vigan City, Calle Crisologo is just 500m away from the bus terminal, so take a quick tricycle ride or get there comfortably on foot.</li>
                </ul>
